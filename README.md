This repository contains a kind of "Case Book" of programs for later use. From Wikipedia article on Casebook, "The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the casebook method and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a lawyer." In a similar vein, this casebook is architected for the author's sheer pleasure to "Think like a Programmer" one step at a time, to lay solid ground work on problem solving techniques and mastery of a programming language through consistent daily practice. 

In Chemistry, an element is the smallest unit of matter that can be combined with other elements to form complex compounds. Elements are the building blocks of complex compounds. All of matter is made up of these complex compounds. Thus, the basic ideas in the code snippets in this ongoing casebook may be used in future works not only to create amazing products but to simplify process creation. External Third Party APIs can be no substitute to the confidence one has in one's own code. It is the basis to the former.
